My name is Hari Krishna Manupadi and I am an Indian Java developer who loves coding and solving problems in a simple yet creative fashion. During my years of development I have grown a strong passion for both front end and backend development which led me to a good understanding of its underlaying technologies.

While user experience still plays a big role in what I enjoy doing, I've learnt how important it is to write stable yet maintainable and scalable solutions. Even though I started out with Java-Servlets, Jsp, I soon naturally came closer to the Spring/Springboot/NodeJS/Angular/Jquery/AJAX/Bootstrap while still embracing more "elegant" technologies such as JavaEE7 either adopting frameworks or by implementing architectures from scratch.

I’m firmly convinced that human interactions and proactive collaborations are key in building great products and writing great software in general. In all the projects I have worked so far I’ve experienced the benefits of practices such as Pair Programming, Test Driven Development, Continuous Delivery and Infrastructure Automation.

### Things I'd like to learn
I would like to explore both **ELK Stack** and **AWS** in the near future because of their functional approach and focus on scalability. Furthermore I'd like to gain a better understanding of **ReactJS**, a great library I've only gotten the chance to scratch the surface of though I think has great potential.
